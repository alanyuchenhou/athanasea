Athanasea is a online game where players run their own rescue centers and rescue animals from sea. We're building it for children to play so that they can have fun and to learn about protecting aquatic animals. Many of us joined this project to learn and practice latest web technologies (e.g. MeteorJS, MongoDB), and it has been a very enjoyable experience. If you are interested in learning more about Athanasea or modern web app development, come in and talk to us in our Gitter chat room! We'd love to add you as a collaborator!
